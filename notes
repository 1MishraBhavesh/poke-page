React Philosopy is everything in your application (app) is made of Components.

Components have properties,props,state.

React native is declarative so it is easy to organise and do complex code.

Props are like
attributes/properties of a
component. It can be
accessed using
this.props.<propName>.
Props can be used to pass
data to a component.


States are the different
states of a component. The
component can change depending on the current
state. 


For example, a
component button can have
a state whether it is pressed
or not. Depending on that,
the component can appear
or do different things.
